# Delta for video-script-skill

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Authors iNNfo L3 Script Documents

The skill MUST author video scripts as iNNfo Level-3 kNNowledge documents that adopt the `video-script` blueprint. The skill MUST NOT author VUS scripts and MUST NOT ship, vendor, or invoke a VUS parser.

#### Scenario: Skill authors an L3 document

- GIVEN a workspace with a registered Video Element and its owning Series
- WHEN the skill authors a script for that Video
- THEN it writes an iNNfo L3 document adopting the `video-script` blueprint
- AND the document validates against the blueprint

#### Scenario: No VUS parser artifact present

- GIVEN the skill directory
- WHEN its files are inspected
- THEN no vendored VUS parser artifact is present
- AND no VUS parse code path is referenced

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Owned Skill With No External Dependency

The system MUST provide a cogNNitive-owned video-script skill embedded in the `video` bluepriNNt package at `iNNfo/specs/bluepriNNts/video/skills/nn-video-script/` that authors iNNfo Level-3 video-script documents and understands iNNfo workspace structure (Series/Video registration). The skill MUST NOT depend on, fork from at run time, or reference any repository outside the monorepo.
(Previously: it authored VUS scripts using a vendored parser and VUS specification.)

#### Scenario: Skill authors a document with no external repository

- GIVEN a workspace with a registered Video Element and its owning Series, and no external video repository present
- WHEN the skill authors a document for that Video
- THEN the document is written to the Video's own folder
- AND no external-repository path is referenced

#### Scenario: No external reference remains

- GIVEN the skill directory
- WHEN its files are inspected
- THEN they reference no repository outside cogNNitive

#### Scenario: Installed copy authors with no monorepo checkout

- GIVEN the skill installed at `~/.agents/skills/nn-video-script/` with no monorepo present
- WHEN the skill authors a valid L3 script document
- THEN it succeeds using only artifacts committed inside the skill

### Requirement: No-Prose-Copy of Syntax Facts

The skill's own documentation and prompts MUST NOT restate blueprint Field names, allowed `type::` values, or other schema facts as literal prose. Every such fact MUST be resolved by reading the blueprint at run time.
(Previously: the prose restricted VUS voice IDs and property names sourced from the pinned VUS spec.)

#### Scenario: Allowed layer type resolved from the blueprint

- GIVEN a document that needs a valid Layer `type::`
- WHEN the skill selects a value
- THEN it reads the allowed values from the `video-script` blueprint, never from a hardcoded list in its own prose

#### Scenario: Restated schema fact rejected in review

- GIVEN a skill document containing a literal Layer `type::` list not sourced from the blueprint
- WHEN skill content is reviewed against this requirement
- THEN it is flagged as a no-prose-copy violation

## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: Self-Hosted Spec Pin

(Reason: the vendored `V_0-3-3.json` VUS spec no longer exists; script validity is enforced by the `video-script` blueprint.)
(Migration: drop the pin check; validate documents against the blueprint.)

### Requirement: Internal Parser Resolution

(Reason: `vus-parse.mjs` and the vendored parser artifact are removed; the engine reads the structured model through innfo-core.)
(Migration: none.)
